<p align="center">11ty plugin for automatically embedding an Itch.io widgets from a game page url.</p>

# Getting started

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/eleventy-plugin-embed-itch-io) ![NPM License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/eleventy-plugin-embed-itch-io)

This is a plugin for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) which automatically creates an [Itch.io embed widget](https://itch.io/docs/creators/widget) from a URL to a game's page.

Install the latest version of this package using npm `npm install eleventy-plugin-embed-itch-io`

### Setup

Then add it to your [Eleventy config](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/) file:

```js
const embedItchIo = require("eleventy-plugin-embed-itch-io");

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
    ...
    eleventyConfig.addPlugin(embedItchIo);
    ...
};
```

To embed a game widget into any Markdown page, use the [shortcode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/) `embedItchIo` and input the URL as parameter into a new line without any other content on the same line.

### Markdown example:

```markdown
Playing games is almost as fun a pastime activity as making games yourself. Although very time consuming both can be very rewarding.

{% embedItchIo "https://cavaleri.itch.io/getting-around-it" %}

This game though was just as painful to play as it was to make.
```

## Advanced usage

### Configurations
The following optional configurations can be used to alter the behaviour of this plugin. To change the configuration, set the target config object when adding the plugin in your eleventy config:

```js
eleventyConfig.addPlugin(embedItchIo, {
  darkMode: true
});
```

| Configuration  | Default                                                                                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                             |

| containerStyle | `'position: relative; aspect-ratio: 552 / 167; width:100%; max-height: 175px;'`                            | Override the inline style for the container div.                                                                                                                  |
| cacheDuration  | `'1w'`                                                                                                     | Cache duration. Use the cache duration syntax from  [@11ty/eleventy-fetch](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/fetch/#change-the-cache-duration) to set this value. |
| darkMode       | `false`                                                                                                    |   Use darkmode. Adds `?dark=true` get parameter to the iframe src. See [widget example](https://itch.io/docs/creators/widget) for demonstration.                  |

| useShortcode    | `true`                                                                                                     | Toggle the behaviour of using shortcode to embed the widget.                                                                                         |

### Responsiveness
The widget is fully responsive by utilizing the [aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio]) css property on the container div. However, the Itch.io widget has a max height of `175px` before the widget is padded with black background colour. To work around this, the container div has a max height of `175px` and a width of `100%` to make sure we break the aspect ratio when going above `175px`;

### Availability

The plugin shortcode can be used on other languages as well. However, the plugin is fetching the Itch.io details asynchronously using `addAsyncShortcode` which is [not supported currently by Handlebars](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/).

#### Nunjucks example

```html
<body>
    <p>Playing games is almost as fun a pastime activity as making games yourself. Although very time consuming both can be very rewarding.</p>
    {% embedItchIo "https://cavaleri.itch.io/getting-around-it" %}
    <p>This game though was just as painful to play as it was to make.</p>
</body>
```

An alternative option to using shortcodes if to enable the `useTransform` option for the plugin configuration.  This option will replace any instance of a link to an Itch.io game which is surrounded by its own `<p></p>` tags. Elventy [transforms](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#transforms) are used in this case to embed the widget, so it alters Eleventyâ€™s HTML output as it is being generated. It does not alter the source file.

#### Handlebars example (with `useTransform: true`)
```html
<body>
    <p>Playing games is almost as fun a pastime activity as making games yourself. Although very time consuming both can be very rewarding.</p>
    <p>https://cavaleri.itch.io/getting-around-it</p>
    <p>This game though was just as painful to play as it was to make.</p>
</body>
```

### Additional notes

- The plugin will require an active internet connection to embed the widget. This is due to the fact that it will query the game page to obtain the unique game ID, which in turn is used to generate the html for the embedded widget.
- If there is no internet access, or the plugin fails in any other way, it will return an empty string (or the original content without any alternations in case of enabling `useTransform`) while logging the relevant error in console.
- This plugin is deliberately designed _only_ to embed widgets when the URL is on its own line, and not inline with other text, when the `useTransform` option is enabled. To do this, it uses a regular expression to recognize Itch.io game URLs. Currently these are the limitations on what it can recognize in a HTML output:
  - The URL *must* be wrapped in a paragraph tag: `<p>`
  - It *can* also be wrapped in an anchor tag, (*inside* the paragraph): `<a>`
  - The URL string *can* have whitespace around it
